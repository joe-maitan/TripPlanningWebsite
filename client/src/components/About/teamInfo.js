My goal is to go out into the world of game design or software engineering and show what I can do. After a couple of years in industry I would love to try and open a gym I can call my own. Living healthy has been huge for me and lifting weights has helped me tremendously. After graduation in December of 2024, I plan to travel to Italy, Greece, Germany, Japan, and many other places.",

I have delved deep into the world of gaming since I was a young adventurer in games such as World of Warcraft, Gears of War, Path of Exile, and League of Legends, and now want to focus more on creating projects for myself that other people will find entertainment in. Godot, FL studio, and Krita have all been tools that have helped me bring out my creative side in my spare time while my core time is spent cooking in professional kitchens and learning the science behind the monitor. I can't wait to see what's in store for us this year!",
